## COMP5411 Rendering Project

This repository contains rendering projects for COMP5411, Advanced Computer Graphics. In this project, we are going to implement the following features:

### Features
- shadowmap: with and without PCF, [PCSS](http://developer.download.nvidia.com/shaderlibrary/docs/shadow_PCSS.pdf) technology
- mirror surfaces: reflection of the environment - [environment mapping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflection_mapping)
- [Projective texture mapping](http://mrl.nyu.edu/~dzorin/cg05/projection-tex.pdf)
- Object interaction within 3D scenario through GPU. [Github](https://github.com/brianxu/GPUPicker)
- [Depth map](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depth_map)
- various types of light source: point light, projection light, etc.
- Weather effect, such as cloudy and rainy, through [sprites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprite_(computer_graphics)).


### Implementation
- Using three.js to implement features.
- Using python simple server to serve the shader files.
- Nodejs
